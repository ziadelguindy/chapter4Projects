/*
Define a class called Odometer that will be used to track fuel and mileage for an
automobile.

1. The class should have instance variables to track the miles driven and
the fuel efficiency of the vehicle in miles per gallon.

2. Include a mutator method  to reset the odometer to zero miles,
3. a mutator method to set the fuel efficiency,
4. a mutator method that accepts miles driven for a trip and adds it to the odometerâ€™s total,
5. an accessor method that returns the number of gallons of gasoline that the vehicle has consumed since the odometer was last reset.

Use your class with a test program that creates several trips with different fuel
efficiencies. You should decide which variables should be public, if any.
=========================================
GIVEN:
1. distance traveled in miles
2. gallons of fuel in your vehicle

GET:
1. Fuel economy
2. remaining fuel from the end of a certain trip.
