/*
1.Define a class called BlogEntry that could be used to store an entry for a Web
log.
 a.The class should have instance variables to store the posterâ€™s username, text of
the entry, and the date of the entry using the Date class from this chapter.
2. Add a constructor that allows the user of the class to set all instance variables. (create methods in this class and invoke them as objects in the main method)
3. add a method, DisplayEntry, that outputs all the instance variables,
4. add method called getSummary that returns the first 10 words from the text (or the entire text if it is less than 10 words).
Test your class from your main method.
